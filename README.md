## rbxts-proximity prompt

A port of the code found on [roblox](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference/property/ProximityPrompt/Style) to typescript.

Does not work exactly as the old module. Key changes are that each individual proximity prompt class must be instantiated by another module, this one does not do so automatically.
